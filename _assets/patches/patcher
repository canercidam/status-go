# Default behaviour:
# Reverts all patches in patch dir, notes down the ones
# which were previously applied. Applies all from the beginning
# and reports about previously unapplied patches. If there's
# an error, reverts the last one and stops.

# Usage: ./patcher -p <base_path> -r -v
# -p: <base_path> is where to apply to (a go-ethereum package)
# -r: reverts all and exit if this flag is present
# -v: verbose error reporting about failed patch
#
# If -p is not present, default path is as below ($basepath).
